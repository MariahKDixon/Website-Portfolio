            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Mariah Dixon. I am 18 years old and a self-taught artist, 
                who dedicated the past 8 years of my life practicing art as a discipline of self-empowerment. 
                Recently, I started encouraging and inspiring others to express themselves in a form of art. 
                I was a member of the National Art Honor Society in Woodstock High School. 
                Drawing is my passion and purpose. I enjoy representational art of figures and people. 
                Iâ€™ve also worked on specific projects with other artists such as logos and book covers. 
                It all started in the fourth grade, Lori Thompson, my art teacher inspired 
                and nurtured by natural talent in a small classroom. During that time, 
                I was silently enduring what I now call one of the hardest times in my life. 
                Art became my escape and an outlet for my imaginations to run wild and
                 my drawings gave a face to the abyss of emotions I suppressed.</p>
